# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

A simple but not so simple tic tac toe implementation for my first project at General Assembly.

My project uses, HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

## Game Link

## The game rules

The game is to be played between two humans.

Player One will be ‘Pusheen the Unicorn’ and Player Two‘Pusheen the man’.
to mark their respective square.

The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has
one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character. Just click on any square to start the game.

If no one wins, then the game will be a draw.

After three rounds, the game will declare the winner or if it is a match and then the board will reset.
