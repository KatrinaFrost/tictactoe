# Project 0 - Tic Tac Toe

A simple but not so simple tic tac toe implementation for my first project at General Assembly.

My project uses, HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

## Game Link and Game rules ##

https://katrinafrost.github.io/tictactoe/

The game is to be played between two humans.

Player One will be ‘Pusheen the Unicorn’ and Player Two‘Pusheen the man’
to mark their respective square.

The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has
one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character. Just click on any square to start the game.

If no one wins, then the game will be a draw.

After three rounds, the game will declare the winner or if it is a match and then the board will reset.

## What issues I experienced ##

- Does not currently add up best of three score
- Timings are a bit off for the pop up box
- JS code is very messy - would like to tidy this up.
- Issues restyling the replay button
- Adding in the timeout function
- Made table in HTML and only found out at 3am on showcase day that I could have done a 2d table in JS.
- Pusheen kept disappearing
- I could not work out the animation so a friend kindly helped me. (I will spend time looking into this to understand it)

## What I would like to add ##

- Social media icons
- Updated pop up and scoreboard when player has won after three rounds of three
- clean code
- Rewrite in Jquery
- Condense code
- More style in General
- Pop up fade in fade out
- Let player choose character
- Local storage
- Customer board sizes
- Networked multiplayer

## What I would do next time ##

- Write my HTML and CSS first
- Write a list of all variables needed and give variables better names. Then work on them one by one in JS
- Use Trello to plan my time efficiently
- DO NOT PANIC CODE
- Learn more CSS
- Tackle smaller chunks at a time and make sure they work before moving on to the next thing
- Git hub often
- Keep track of my thought process
